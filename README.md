# ECM2423
AI including EA to solve sudoko and A* to solve 8-puzzle problem

Read me for ECM2423 Submission

I have created this code on python version 3.10.2. So if you run the code please make sure you are using that version.

The code should not have any other required downloads to run as the other imported contents is from the generic python libraries

The submission file contains 11 files

This readme

The PDF of the written answers and other content required for marking.

The 2 scripts for the A* search. Set and General.

The Sudoku EA.

3 Files containing the grids for the EA.

The Excel tables and charts - these will all be in the PDF but if you need a closer look or have issues seeing them in the PDF you can consult this.

2 files containing the raw data for the running of tests for the EA and the A*.

The running instructions will be in the PDF but generally to run anything python related:

Windows/Linux

python FileName.py

And for Mac

python3 FileName.py 

Also editors note, throughout the code I have chosen (completely didn't do this by accident because I cannot spell :)) to spell Sudoku as Suduko. By the time I noticed it was too late to change and was littered through so much of my work, it would cause more harm than good to fix.
